						<h2>In the beginning...</h2>
				        <p>My great grandfather (Albert Ernest Nelson) worked in a glass factory in East Belfast, He gave his son (My grandad; James William Nelson) the idea of going to stately homes to clean the chandeliers. </p>
                <p>So he did and the company Elite Crystal Services was born.<p>

              <h2>Inspired by my grandfathers stories</h2>
				        <p>When I was 5 my grandad would tell me the stories of visiting the stately homes and grand manor houses all over Ireland. </p>
                <p>This inspired me to want to learn the trade to continue our chandelier cleaning company.</p>

               <h2>Learning a trade at a young age</h2>
				        <p>At 14 I went on my first chandelier cleaning job at a large country manor house, this only went to increase my enthusiasm for our chandelier business. </p>
                <p>The sight of that large manor house was enough to keep me inspired for a lifetime.</p>
